Perfect. You're right. Consistency is key. Here is the API version, following the exact same format and structure as your Playwright README.

# API Testing Suite

A collection of API tests built with Python's `requests` library to validate CRUD operations against the JSONPlaceholder API. This project demonstrates foundational skills in API testing, including sending requests, handling responses, and validating data integrity.

## 🚀 Overview

This suite tests critical API endpoints to ensure reliable create, read, update, and delete functionality. Automating these checks provides rapid feedback on API stability and data consistency.

## 📋 Test Cases Automated

**test_get_users.py: Verify successful retrieval of user data.**
*   **Action:** Sends a GET request to the `/users` endpoint.
*   **Validation:** Asserts a 200 OK status code and validates the response structure contains expected user data.

**test_create_post.py: Verify successful creation of a new post.**
*   **Action:** Sends a POST request to the `/posts` endpoint with a JSON payload.
*   **Validation:** Asserts a 201 Created status code and validates the response contains the submitted data.

**test_update_post.py: Verify successful update of an existing post.**
*   **Action:** Sends a PUT request to the `/posts/1` endpoint with an updated JSON payload.
*   **Validation:** Asserts a 200 OK status code and validates the response reflects the updated data.

**test_delete_post.py: Verify successful deletion of a post.**
*   **Action:** Sends a DELETE request to the `/posts/1` endpoint.
*   **Validation:** Asserts a 200 OK status code.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
